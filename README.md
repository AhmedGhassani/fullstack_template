# Full Stack Template

## About

The purpose of this template is to streamline getting an api and web app up and running without worrying about configuring the local environment and different versions of tools. It provides all the neccessary boilerplate code and fundamental aspects of a full stack app. From setting up initial API endpoints, basic user auth on the web app and setting up a DB with all the initial tables.

This prevents the developer from loosing intrest in developing what matters by providing them with redundent code which most applications this day and age consist of.
